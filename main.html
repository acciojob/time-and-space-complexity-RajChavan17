	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is mesured used in to evalute the efficiency of the algorithms. It helps us to understand how the running time of an algorithms changes as the input size increases. An efficient algorithm will have a time complexity that grows slowly relative to the size of the input.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a measure of amount of memory an algorithm uses as the size of the input grows. It is usually expressed as a function of the input size, with the common notation like <b>O(n)</b> representing a linear growth in memory usage as the input size increases.</p>
